# learning-to-code
Good job, you found the README! Whenever you look at a collection of code and see a README, you should read that first. It's like an orientation.

To see this page as it was intended, click "Download ZIP". It will download, probably to your desktop. Then find it in Finder or your file library, double-click on the .zip file, and the page should open in your browser of choice (if you're not already using Google Chrome, do it).

This is documentation about how to get started learning to code, and some of the background knowledge you should learn because people will start to assume you know it. I hope it's helpful to you!
