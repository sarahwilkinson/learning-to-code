  <h1>Assumed Knowledge</h1>

    <p>This document is for people who want to learn how to code and have found they need to know some other stuff first.</p>

    <p>Instructors who are curious about why I wrote this document should go <a href="forInstructors.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>1. First thing to know: Being scared will prevent you from learning.</h2>

    <p>It's ok to be scared, but you have a decision to make: If you feel scared, are you going to give up?</p>

    <p>You might end up asking yourself that question several times. That's ok, too. Just know that if you decide to quit, you won't be able to learn this stuff until you decide to try again. You're going to have to speak up every single time you don't understand something. You're going to feel embarrassed. To succeed, your will to learn must be stronger than your fear of embarrassment or of hard work.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the class, make sure you talk to the instructor about your expectations. If your expectations change, or you feel the instructor's expectations change, consider talking to the instructor again. Try starting with, "I think our expectations for this class are different. Can we talk about that?"</p>

    <p>Are you expecting someone to sit down next to you and walk you through how to do things, or are you expecting to have questions ready for topics you've already studied yourself? Make sure the instructor has the same expectations. It may be that they are not prepared to walk students through things that they consider "too basic" for the course. Both parties should do their best to agree on what kind of teaching can be expected.</p>

    <p>The point of this page is to give you some of the vocabulary and basic concepts you'll need to start learning to code. Once you have some questions, you can search the internet for a lot of your answers, as is expected of a programmer. However, be somewhat careful. You'll learn over time and by discussing with other programmers how to tell which websites have good information and which ones are not reliable. Until then, check with your instructor or programming friend whether a source has correct, up-to-date information. Later sections on this page will have some examples of trusted sources.</p>

  <h2>2. What is a computer?</h2>

    <p>It is a thing that can be given some words or numbers as input and give back a different output, according to rules that a human being has "taught" or "programmed" it to follow.</p>

    <p>The word "computer" comes from the word "to compute," which means to calculate or do math. For instance, when you see the characters "1 + 1," you probably "compute" that the answer is 2.</p>

    <p>The computer started out as a calculator that was so big it took up a whole room. All you could do was translate what you wanted to tell the computer to do into a language kind of like Braille. The language was called Fortran and made up of holes punched in paper -- "punchcards" -- and all the computer did with Fortran was math.</p>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/IBM_704_mainframe.gif" class="images">

    <p>Above photo: Black-and-white image of an early computer that took up a whole room. Description: Boxy, silvery machines sit on a linoleum floor under fluorescent lights.</p>

    <p>Eventually, people realized they could replace numbers with other things. The computer really only understands numbers, and the numbers are really only 0s and 1s, which stand for "on" and "off". However, you can make the computer "speak" to you in words and symbols that are easier for people to understand--these are programming languages. You can even make it display colors on the screen to make images that human beings can learn to understand (the "graphical user interface"). However, the "rules" computers follow can only be based on "equivalence," or making one thing equal to another. It does not understand shades of grey.</p>

    <p>A computer does that with electricity. It can <i>only</i> understand yes or no. YES, these two things are equal, or NO, these two things are not equal. YES, the electrical current in this position is ON; or NO, the electricity in this position is OFF. So if you want it to understand anything more complicated than that, you have break it down into manageable pieces--like explaining something to a kid.</p>

    <p>Now, computers do so many things that you don't even need to understand electricity to work with them. You can forget about all of this if you want to--in fact, <b>it's a good idea to forget about it until later.</b></p>

    <p>I personally have found that if I thought about this stuff, how computers actually work, it just scared me. But when I forgot about it and just moved forward with memorizing things that trusted instructors told me to memorize, I found myself looking back later and thinking "Hey, yeah, it makes sense now. I had to forget about that stuff in order to learn, but now that I know some more stuff, I can see how it could be helpful to understand how computers really work."</p>

    <p>By the way, it's important to only listen to people and sources you trust for learning to code. The worst that can happen, in case you're wondering, is probably that you could delete all the "stuff" that makes your computer work--and it might not be fixable. It's unlikely but possible. It's also possible that you'll give your computer a "virus" by mistake, usually from a fake website that looks real. More on that later.</p>

  <h2>3. Some vocabulary</h2>

    <p>So, we talked about what computers are. But how do you start learning about them? Maybe you've heard people talk about them and been so confused you felt you could never understand anything. Well, it turns out that sometimes you have to learn new words, or even a new language, to learn about a new thing. Sometimes people who know a lot about the thing don't even know how to explain it in plain language anymore.</p>

    <p>For computer stuff generally, knowing some vocabulary is important because you're often expected to search the internet for answers to your own questions. But how can you do that if you don't even know the words for asking your question, or which sources you should trust for the answers? Hopefully, this short glossary will help.</p>

</div>
<div class="glossary">

  <li><b>internet</b>: Basically, the internet is a way that computers can talk to each other, even over long distances. It's also called "the World Wide Web," and that's why the address of websites often start with "www."</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>website</b>: visual "pages" of the internet that you can see on a computer screen when you type the address of a website in the URL bar or click on a link.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>address</b>: Also known as a web address, link, URL, or URL address. This is the text you see in the "URL bar," which is the white bar at the top of your browser window. What the address really does is give the internet directions on where to go to get the pages you have asked it to find. It's as if each â€˜page' was a photograph that was located in a certain mailbox, and you had to tell someone which mailbox to open to find it.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>browser</b>: A computer is just a boring machine until you add applications to it. One of these applications is usually an "internet browser," which is a tool you use to browse the internet, or see pages in it. <br></br>Note: There are several different types of browser; some are better for certain things than others. The ones you probably have used before are Internet Explorer, which is a Microsoft product that works on PCs; Safari, which is made by Apple and works on Macs. However, people who work with computers usually prefer one of the following: Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome (also called "Firefox" and "Chrome").</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>server</b>: A website is made by a person or a bunch of people, like a company. Their computers have to have a way to let your computer "see" the pages of the website. So, they have a computer that acts as a server, which means it puts the pages of the website on the internet for your computer to "grab."</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>client</b>: Usually, this means your computer, or the computer that "takes" the pages of websites put onto the internet by the server.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>server side</b>: This means something that has to do with the computer that puts the pages onto the internet, or that updates them with changes.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>client side</b>: This means something that a computer looks at on the internet, rather than something it has created.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>visual interface</b>: A computer screen. Remember how we said computers have been taught how to create images that people can understand? That's what this means. It's also called the "GUI," or Graphical User Interface.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>interface</b>: An "interface" is when two systems (a human and a computer, for instance) interact, or something that translates instructions. For example, a telephone is an "interface" that two people can use to communicate from far away. It takes the sounds one person makes and delivers them to the person listening.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>GUI</b>: (pronounced "gooey") An even fancier word for the visual interface. It means the same thing, and stands for "graphical user interface".</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>graphical</b>: This word means "visual"; something you can see or that has a shape.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>user</b>: A person using a computer, tool, app, application, or product.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>app</b>: This word is short for "application." It means a bunch of instructions that you can "install" on your computer to make it do something, like connect to the internet.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>program</b>: Another word for "application." It is also a word that means "to make software," as in "to program."</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>window</b>: When you open an application on your computer, it usually shows up as a window. Windows are usually big squares or rectangles of a certain color that makes it clear that you are using a specific application. You might be reading this document in a window right now, unless it's printed on paper. But the window it's in might make it look like it's paper, so you feel like you're reading from paper.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>file</b>: This word comes from the same kind of paper or plastic file you might have in an office, and which holds papers. For a computer, a file is a bunch of instructions and information that it "remembers" and keeps at a specific location in its memory.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>hardware</b>: It's easy to forget that a computer is made of metal parts with electricity running through them, but it is. Those parts are called the hardware.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>software</b>: Today, most people only use software, which are the tools that make images show up on the computer screen. Most software involves the internet.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>programming</b>: To write a set of instructions for a computer or application to follow, and to position them in the correct place for the computer to follow these instructions. A person uses programming "languages" such as Python and JavaScript to "talk" to computers.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>coding</b>: "Coding" means the same thing as "programming."</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>operating system (OS)</b>: A set of rules the computer is programmed to follow when it is first built. Technically, the key difference between Macs and PCs is the "operating system"--most Macs have an Apple-produced OS, like SnowLeopard, while PCs usually run on Windows (Windows 8, 9, etc). Their hardware looks different, but you can run most of the same software on them both.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>version control</b>: Basically, this means keeping track of any changes you make to a document or program. That way, if you make a mistake and save it by accident, you can go back to the last "version" that existed before the mistake. The way many software products work is by releasing several "versions" that contain "updates." If you don't keep the "version" of your software up-to-date, it will stop working.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>software updates</b>: You know those annoying windows that pop up telling you you need to update your software on your computer or phone? Well, you actually do need to do what they say. (Unless it's a virus with a fake update message, trying to trick you.) See, unlike when you have a car or a toaster, software won't work for very long without updates. Applications and programs need to be constantly updated as new "bugs" are identified and fixed. You might think "But it's still working just fine for me, so I won't update it." However, somewhere along the line, you'll probably find that when you need that program to interact with another program, it won't because it's not updated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>virus</b>: A piece of software that does something undesirable, like send your private information or credit card number to someone who will abuse it. To avoid downloading a virus by accident, think about what someone might do to try to trick you into downloading it. How would you try to make something look legitimate? How would you make someone feel they must click on the link or download the virus?</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Mackeeper</b>: A commonly known virus that pops up telling you you must "clean up" your Mac. Don't do it! This is a scam!</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>hacker</b>: This word is sometimes used to mean a person who uses their computer skills for "evil," but many programmers proudly refer to themselves as "hackers." The idea is that "hacking" systems makes them easier to use, or adapting them to use for a different purpose than intended.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>keystroke</b>: Pressing a key on your keyboard.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>command</b>: When you give a computer or a program an "instruction."</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>command line interface</b>: This is the program you must use in order to give your computer instructions. If you're giving instructions to a browser, you use the "console" as the command line interface instead.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>file path</b>: When you want to put a page of text or images on the internet, your computer acts as a server to "give" those pages to the internet. The way the internet "finds" these pages is by following the "file path," which tells it what file the information is in on your computer. This is the reason you should put all your coding files in a specific file structure. Make lots of folders that contain relatively few items apiece, all contained in an "umbrella" folder for the project. Make folders within folders, then more folders. If you put files with the same name inside the same folder, the computer won't know which is which. More on this in section 6.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>power cycling</b>: Sometimes, turning a computer off and then on again will fix problems for unknown reasons. You can do the same with an application or program by "quitting," "forcing quit," or closing it and then restarting or reopening it. This kind of problem solving is called "power cycling."</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>troubleshooting</b>: This means the process of finding out where a problem is so that you can fix it.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>HTML</b>: This means the text of a web page. It stands for "hypertext markup language." A programmer creates a file with the text and with certain instructions to the computer for how to present it, like whether it is bolded or italicized and what size the font is.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>CSS</b>: HTML code deals with the text style of a page, while CSS ("cascading style sheet") tells the browser what the page should look like, such as its color.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>JavaScript</b>: JavaScript is the only other programming language that a web browser knows how to read besides HTML and CSS. This is why JavaScript is important for making beautiful, functional web pages.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>front-end</b>: The kind of coding that goes into building the look and function of a webpage is known as "front-end engineering," because it is like the storefront that a visitor to the page sees.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>query</b>: When you ask your browser to display a webpage, this is what happens. Your browser sends a 'query,' or a request, to the server of the webpage to give the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is needed to reproduce the webpage on your browser screen. When it gets this code, it rebuilds the webpage for you to look at and interact with, but doesn't show you the code unless you ask for it.</li>

  <h2>4. What kind of computer are you using?</h2>

    <img class="images" src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/inspiron14R-e1345226239993.png" height="200px" width="200px">

    <img class="images" src="http://images.macworld.com/images/news/graphics/131583-mbair_large.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

    <p>Above: A dark grey "PC" laptop computer, and a silver Mac laptop computer.</p>

    <p>There are two main types of computers: Macs, which are usually smooth and silver or white and have an apple-shaped symbol on them. Then there are PCs, which are usually dark grey or black. "PC" stands for "personal computer," and while Macs fall into this category, people tend to group them as Macs and PCs. (There are also less common types, like Chromebooks and Dells.) The main differences between different computer types is that they have different Operating Systems (OS) and different versions of their Operating System depending on how recently the computer's software has been updated. There are Mac and PC versions of "desktop" computers as well, which, unlike laptops, are not made to be portable.</p>

    <p>Macs have their own Operating Systems (OS), while PCs usually run on an OS called "Windows". (We won't worry about other types for now, but they include names like Linux and Unix.)</p>

    <p>Why does that matter? Because the operating systems are different, and sometimes you have to use different tools to interact with them. Their keyboards usually have slightly different keystroke names and symbols. Also, sometimes one kind of computer does a certain thing better than another kind.</p>

    <p>Different types of computers also have different "applications." That means that the tools you use to create files on the computer, or the way your computer connects to the internet, will be different depending on what kind it is and what kind of "applications" you can put on your computer. Most popular applications have a "Mac" version and a "Windows" version, and sometimes a Linux version.</p>

    <p>One application you will likely interact with quite a bit is Google Chrome, an application made and maintained by Google that has "built-in dev tools." In other words, using Chrome makes it easier to see the code that was used to build the page.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

  <h2>5. Symbols & Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

      <p>You may find that when you try to search for answers to your coding questions on the internet, many pages contain symbols as part of explanations. You can usually Google the symbol (for instance, "what does $ mean in JavaScript") if you don't know it, but this section contains some common symbols to get you started.</p>

      <p>Note that symbols are different for Macs and PCs/Windows, and they usually indicate a certain keystroke on the keyboard of a Mac or PC. You can also look at your keyboard and notice that some common symbols are on the keys and indicate the same keystroke.</p>

      <p>The "power" button, to turn a device on or off, usually looks like this: <img src="http://simpleicon.com/wp-content/uploads/powe-symbol-2.png" height="50px" width="50px"></p>

      <p>The "shift" key is sometimes represented by upward-facing arrow-like symbols : <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/ISOIEC-9995-7-001--ISO-7000-0251--Symbol-for-Level-2-Select.svg/130px-ISOIEC-9995-7-001--ISO-7000-0251--Symbol-for-Level-2-Select.svg.png" height="50px" width="50px"></p>

      <p>The "command" key on Macs is sometimes represented by this symbol: <img src="http://demosthenes.info/assets/images/thumbnails/command-key-symbol.svg" height="50px" width="50px"></p>

      <p>The "control" key on a PC usually serves a similar function as the "command" key on a Mac, and its symbol looks like this: <img src="http://cdn.flaticon.com/png/256/26003.png" height="50px" width="50px"></p>
      <br>
      <p>You will also find that sometimes symbols are used to show you a "keyboard shortcut."</p>

      <p><b>What is a keyboard shortcut?</b></p>

      <p>You interact with your computer in two ways: Through the keyboard, and through the "GUI" (i.e., by using the mouse or trackpad). Most people use the GUI, but programmers tend to prefer using the keyboard more because it's faster and more efficient.</p>

      <p>For example, one common keyboard shortcut that works in most applications is "Command + S" for Macs or "Ctrl + S" in Windows. This is a useful one, because--fun fact!--nothing that you create can be used by the computer or application until you have "saved" your work.</p>

      <p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p>

      <p>This is important because a lot of people trying to teach you programming probably use keyboard shortcuts all the time. When they show you how to do something, they may use keyboard shortcuts, which makes it look like the screen is changing all by itself. Make sure to ask them what keyboard shortcuts they used if you're confused.</p>

      <p>Here are resources for learning more keyboard shortcuts, if you're interested.</p>

  <h2>6. Tips for file structure</h2>

      <p>It turns out that just learning a programming language won't help you much if you don't know how to organize the files on your computer that you want to work with. This is partly because you will soon put some pages onto the internet, and in order to do that you will need to tell the browser where to find the code you wrote. Eventually, you will also use the command line interface to create files, delete them, put them on the internet, and move them around without looking at them.</p>

        <div class="indented">

        <p><b>Why is this important?</b></p>

        <p>When you tell the computer to go get a file, it can only identify the file by its name and its "file path."</p>

        <p><b>What is the "file path"?</b></p>

        <p>The computer organizes information in a specific way called a "nested file structure." "Nested" means that files are contained in folders, those folders are grouped into and contained by more folders, and so on until you get to one folder that holds everything. One good way to visualize the folder structure is as a "tree" with many branches. In fact, the file on your computer that contains all the other files is called the "root folder". So, just as if you were to tell someone how to get to a specific twig or leaf on a tree, you must tell your computer which "branches" to go to in your nested file structure to find the correct file.</p>

        <img src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nested-directory-structure-to-flatten.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
        <img src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC139595.gif" height="200px" width="200px">

        <p>Above: Examples of how the GUI represents the concept of a nested file structure, also known as a hierarchy. The arrow or +/- symbol to the left of a line can be clicked to show or hide the files or sub-folders contained in that particular location.</p>

        <p>When you put text into the URL bar in your browser, you are actually giving the browser a "file path" to get to the correct files of code for that webpage. When you're visiting a website someone else created, the URL tells that site's server where to find the code for a page in its own files. If the site is made of files you wrote and stored on your computer, then your own computer is acting as the server. You will see that your file path gets shorter or longer depending on where you put your folders and files. This is why many coders keep current projects open on their desktop before moving them to a final storage place; it makes them easier to find and gives a shorter file path than if they were nested many levels deep.</p>

        <p>There is actually a convention among programmers for naming the files of code that create web pages. For instance, the main text of the main webpage is usually named "index.html" and kept within a folder specific to that page and website. This is important because, as you can guess, once you have multiple projects or sites or pages you have to have a way to distinguish between "index.html" for one site's main page and the "index.html" of another. The way this is done is by putting the "index.html" file for that webpage into the appropriate folder, which then becomes part of the file path. The file name will be the same, but the file path will cause the computer to retrieve the correct file.</p>

      <p><b>So, to help you get started, follow these rules:</b></p>
        <p></p>

      <p>1. Create unique, short names for each file and each folder.</p>
        <p></p>

      <p>2. Have one main folder for each project.</p>
        <p></p>

      <p>3. Within a project's main folder, break down the work into smaller chunks with their own separate folders where possible. Then break down those contents, too. Keep different types of content categorized, like having a separate content sheet (HTML) for each page and a stylesheet (CSS) for each group of pages sharing similar style components. This is how a "nested" file structure works. The concept is similar to the "document-object model" that governs the organization of webpages.</p>
        <p></p>

      <p>4. Remember that nothing works until it is "saved." Save your work in each file frequently. To save time, practice looking up and using a keyboard shortcut that causes a file to be "saved". (With the file open, try clicking on "File" in the menu bar across the top of your screen, looking for the "Save" option, and deciphering the symbols to the right of the text. Ta-da! You can use this method to learn many new keyboard shortcuts in various applications.) Make sure you're in the window that contains the correct file when you use the keyboard shortcut, as it will only affect the window that is currently open.</p>
