<h1>Information for Instructors</h1>

<p>[<a href="index.html">Back to Student Page</a>]</p>

<p>This page is for instructors seeking to teach computer science or coding, and to make it friendly to beginners (even if your class is for non-beginners). Students wanting to learn to code should go <a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Send your students to the above page when they need a better understanding of computer use before they can learn to code. Remember, not everyone who knows how to use a computer has ever touched code, and may not know some crucial information that only comes from interacting with code.</p>

<p>Now, for you, the instructor: <b>What is asssumed knowledge, and why should you care?</b></p>

<p>"Assumed knowledge" is a huge part of what keeps people from learning what they want to learn. If for the millionth time you feel you must risk embarrassment in front of people you think might be hostile to you, you might decide you just don't have the energy for it that time--and another student is lost.</p>

<p>People who want to learn to code enter a unique academic environment. Programming is a relatively young subject, and there is no universal governing body that defines levels of mastery or the knowledge they involve. Many accomplished programmers have taught themselves much of their craft, and sometimes they assume other computer users have also been as determined and able to seek out that kind of knowledge. It's important to note that access to resources and education varies widely across geography and socioeconomic disparity, so some people don't even get exposed to what's possible with computers and the internet, much less the ways to find accurate information to answer their questions. Other factors that keep certain demographics out of a field like computer science include the fear of embarrassment during the learning process, and their comparison of their own self-image against that of most coders: White men. By making yourself and the field as approachable as possible, other demographics can join the community and address a wider variety of challenges than have thus far been addressed by computer science. The page for students is designed to be a resource for coding or computer-using beginners.</p>

<p>The teacher has the most power in deciding how welcoming they want their classroom to be, and what level of experience they will assume. It's fine to assume a certain level of knowledge <i>as long as you communicate it clearly in advance</i>. No matter whether you're starting at zero are starting at 60, you must clearly communicate that bar to your students.</p>

<p>In this way, assumed knowledge has a direct analogy in programming: You must tell the computer everything. How can the computer know rules it hasn't been explicitly programmed to follow?  Not everyone knows how to type "properly," and not everyone knows what a "file" is, no matter how basic those items may seem.</p>

<p>Are you prepared to teach someone knowledge that you consider "basic," or are you expecting your students to know some things already? Are you prepared to teach someone what it means to "right-click," or are you prepared only to support more advanced questions? As much as possible, ensure the messaging and advertising for the course targets students with the expected level of knowledge--without assuming anything. That, of course, is easier said than done.</p>

<p>Clearly communicating about expectations before the class starts is crucial. Then, once the class has begun, try to gauge where your students are. I suggest starting any kind of "class" or group endeavor with a dialogue, in which all participants discuss and ultimately agree upon guidelines and boundaries for their experience together. Align expectations. Don't just tell students what to do; ask them what they think. Establish a two-way street of communication, learning, and feedback. You know what they say when you assume!</p>
